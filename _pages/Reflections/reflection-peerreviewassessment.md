# Introduction
In this assignment, you will engage in a peer review process to assess a fellow student's computer science lesson plan. Your task is to critically analyze the lesson plan, considering its objectives, content, teaching strategies, and alignment with educational standards. You will provide constructive feedback that can help your peer enhance the effectiveness of their teaching.

# Instructions
1. **Develop a Rubric**: As a class, develop a rubric to evaluate the lesson plan that we will all use.  Apply this rubric in your evaluation.
2. **Review the Lesson Plan**: Carefully read the lesson plan assigned to you.
3. **Write Your Review**: Write a detailed review, addressing the questions provided.
4. **Submit Your Review**: Submit your review by the deadline.

# Questions to Consider
1. "What were the strengths of the lesson plan you reviewed?"
2. "What areas of the lesson plan could be improved?"
3. "How would you apply the feedback you provided in your own teaching?"

# Evaluation
Your review will be shared anonymously with your paired student.  Each student will review approximately three lesson plans.  Your review will be evaluated based on the quality of your analysis, the depth of your insights, and the constructiveness of your feedback. Please refer to the rubric for specific criteria.

# Reflection
Reflect on this peer review process. How did it enhance your understanding of computer science pedagogy? How can you apply what you learned to your own teaching practice?
