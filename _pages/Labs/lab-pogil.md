# Assignment Overview
In this assignment, you will design a POGIL (Process-Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning) activity for a specific computer science concept. You will explore the importance of collaborative and active learning in computer science education.

# Instructions
- **Choose a Computing Lesson Concept**: Select a computing lesson concept that you would like to teach.
- **Design a POGIL Activity**: Create a POGIL activity that aligns with the lesson concept, fostering collaborative and inquiry-based learning.
- **Write the Activity Guide**: Develop a comprehensive guide for the POGIL activity, including learning objectives, roles, questions, and facilitation strategies.
- **Reflect on the Process**: Write a reflection on the process of using POGIL principles, including insights, challenges, and the importance of active learning.

# Notes
- **Understanding POGIL**: Familiarize yourself with the POGIL framework by reading the provided materials and exploring examples on the [CS POGIL website](https://cspogil.org/Computer+Science+1).
- **Collaboration**: Consider how to foster collaboration and inquiry within the POGIL activity.
- **Alignment**: Ensure that the POGIL activity aligns with the overall lesson objectives and content.
- **Reflection**: Reflecting on the process is a key component of this assignment. Consider what you learned and how you might apply POGIL in the future.
