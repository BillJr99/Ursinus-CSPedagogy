    description: Clarity of Learning Objectives
    preemerging: Learning objectives are missing or unclear.
    beginning: Learning objectives are present but lack specificity or alignment with the chosen computing concept.
    progressing: Learning objectives are clear and aligned with the chosen computing concept but could be more comprehensive.
    proficient: Learning objectives are clear, specific, comprehensive, and well-aligned with the chosen computing concept.

    description: Use of Roles, Questions, and Models
    preemerging: Roles, questions, and models are missing or lack relevance to the POGIL activity.
    beginning: Roles, questions, and models are present but lack depth or clear connection to the computing concept.
    progressing: Roles, questions, and models are well-designed but could be more engaging or closely aligned with the computing concept.
    proficient: Roles, questions, and models are engaging, well-designed, and closely aligned with the computing concept.

    description: Promotion of Collaborative Inquiry
    preemerging: Activity lacks elements that promote collaborative inquiry.
    beginning: Activity includes some elements of collaborative inquiry but lacks cohesion or effectiveness.
    progressing: Activity promotes collaborative inquiry but could be more innovative or engaging.
    proficient: Activity effectively and innovatively promotes collaborative inquiry, fostering deep understanding of the computing concept.

    description: Completeness of Facilitator's Guide and Depth of Reflection
    preemerging: Facilitator's guide is incomplete or missing, and reflection lacks depth.
    beginning: Facilitator's guide includes basic elements, and reflection shows some insight but lacks connections to POGIL.
    progressing: Facilitator's guide is comprehensive, and reflection shows good insight and connections to POGIL but could be more reflective.  One of the 12 principles of computing pedagogy is incorporated and discussed in the lesson.
    proficient: Facilitator's guide is complete and insightful, and reflection is deep, thoughtful, and well-connected to POGIL principles.  One of the 12 principles of computing pedagogy is incorporated and discussed in the lesson.

## POGIL Lesson Activity

### Overview
For this assignment, you will design a POGIL activity to teach a computing concept of your choice. This activity should promote collaborative, inquiry-based learning. Additionally, you will choose one of the [12 principles of CS pedagogy provided by the CSTA](https://teachcomputing.org/pedagogy), and incorporate it into your lesson plan.

### Instructions
Choose a computing concept you want students to learn. Consider abstraction, algorithms, data representation, or other core CS ideas.

1. Develop a POGIL activity that teaches this concept through collaborative inquiry. Your activity should include:
   - A central question or problem to explore
   - Specific roles for group members
   - A series of guiding questions for students to discuss and answer
   - Models, diagrams, or representations to scaffold inquiry
   - Summative assessment questions
   - Integration of one of the [12 principles of CS pedagogy](https://teachcomputing.org/pedagogy) into the lesson plan

2. Write a complete facilitator's guide for implementing the POGIL activity. Include:
   - Learning objectives
   - Prerequisite skills/knowledge
   - Instructions for setting up groups
   - Guidance on facilitating the activity
   - Answer key and explanations for the questions
   - Tips for making the activity accessible to all students
   - Links to standards addressed

3. Write a 300-500 word reflection on the process of developing this activity. Discuss:
   - Why you chose this concept and activity structure
   - How you incorporated POGIL principles
   - How you selected and incorporated one of the [12 principles of CS pedagogy](https://teachcomputing.org/pedagogy), including where you made the revision and why
   - Challenges faced and how you overcame them
   - How you could improve the activity in the future
   - The value of collaborative inquiry in CS education
