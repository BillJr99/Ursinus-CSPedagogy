    description: Lesson Plan Development
    preemerging: Lesson plan lacks clear structure and integration of SEL principles.
    beginning: Lesson plan includes basic structure but integration of SEL is superficial or forced.
    progressing: Lesson plan is well-structured with thoughtful integration of SEL, but lacks depth in some areas.
    proficient: Lesson plan is comprehensive, well-structured, and seamlessly integrates SEL into the ASCII encoding topic.

    description: Activities Design
    preemerging: Activities are unclear or unrelated to SEL and ASCII encoding.
    beginning: Activities include some connection to SEL and ASCII encoding but lack engagement or creativity.
    progressing: Activities are engaging and foster SEL skills, but could be more closely aligned with ASCII encoding.
    proficient: Activities are highly engaging, foster specific SEL skills, and are closely aligned with ASCII encoding.

    description: Assessment Strategies
    preemerging: Assessment strategies are missing or do not align with the goals of teaching SEL and ASCII encoding.
    beginning: Assessment strategies are present but lack clarity or alignment with SEL and ASCII encoding objectives.
    progressing: Assessment strategies are clear and aligned with SEL and ASCII encoding objectives but lack variety or depth.
    proficient: Assessment strategies are clear, varied, and deeply aligned with both SEL and ASCII encoding objectives.

    description: Reflection and Considerations
    preemerging: Reflection is missing or lacks insight into the importance of integrating SEL into computer science education.
    beginning: Reflection includes basic insights but lacks depth or consideration of specific SEL skills and resources.
    progressing: Reflection is thoughtful and includes consideration of specific SEL skills and resources but could be more comprehensive.
    proficient: Reflection is insightful, comprehensive, and includes deep consideration of specific SEL skills, resources, and the broader context of computer science education.

# Assignment Overview
In this assignment, you will develop a lesson plan that integrates social emotional learning (SEL) into a computer science topic. Specifically, you will explore data encoding using ASCII characters and design activities that foster SEL skills such as collaboration, empathy, and self-awareness.

# Instructions
- **Develop a Lesson Plan**: Create a detailed lesson plan that integrates SEL into teaching data encoding with ASCII characters.
- **Include Activities**: Design engaging activities that foster SEL skills.
- **Assessment**: Outline how you will assess students' understanding of both SEL and ASCII encoding.
- **Reflection**: Write a reflection on the importance of integrating SEL into computer science education.

# Considerations
- **Integrating SEL**: Consider how SEL principles can be naturally integrated into the lesson without feeling forced or artificial.
- **Fostering Skills**: Think about how the lesson can foster specific SEL skills such as collaboration, empathy, and self-awareness.
- **Assessment Strategies**: Consider various assessment strategies to gauge students' understanding of both SEL and ASCII encoding.
- **Resources**: Provide resources and tools that students can use to explore ASCII encoding, such as ASCII tables or online encoding tools.
- **Reflection**: Encourage students to reflect on their learning experience, both in terms of the computer science content and the SEL skills developed.

# Examples
The following are a few examples of how SEL might be incorporated into various computing topics:

## Data Encoding with ASCII Characters
    - **Introduction to ASCII**: Introduce ASCII encoding and its importance in computer science.
    - **Collaborative Encoding Activity**: Students work in pairs to encode a message using ASCII, fostering collaboration and communication skills.
    - **Empathy Exercise**: Students reflect on the challenges of encoding and decoding, including identifying the shortcomings of encodings for those with expanded language character sets.
    - **Self-awareness Reflection**: Students reflect on their own learning process, identifying strengths and areas for improvement upon the ASCII standard.

## Collaborative Programming (Teamwork, Communication)
   - **Lesson**: Pair programming or group projects.
   - **SEL Focus**: Emphasize collaboration, effective communication, and empathy.
   - **Example Activity**: Students work in pairs to develop a small application, switching roles between driver and navigator, reflecting on collaboration.

## Debugging Challenges (Resilience, Problem-Solving)
   - **Lesson**: Debugging exercises and overcoming coding challenges.
   - **SEL Focus**: Foster resilience and problem-solving skills.
   - **Example Activity**: Students debug code with intentional errors, reflecting on resilience.

## Ethical Considerations in Computing (Ethics, Empathy)
   - **Lesson**: Exploring ethical dilemmas in technology.
   - **SEL Focus**: Encourage empathy and ethical reasoning.
   - **Example Activity**: Students debate ethical considerations of AI, focusing on empathy.

## Inclusive Design (Empathy, Inclusivity)
   - **Lesson**: Designing software with accessibility in mind.
   - **SEL Focus**: Teach empathy and inclusivity.
   - **Example Activity**: Students design an accessible web page, reflecting on inclusivity.

## Data Encoding with ASCII Characters (Collaboration, Self-Awareness)
   - **Lesson**: Teaching data encoding using ASCII.
   - **SEL Focus**: Enhance collaboration and self-awareness.
   - **Example Activity**: Students work in pairs to encode a message using ASCII, reflecting on challenges.

## **Cybersecurity and Digital Citizenship (Responsibility, Ethics)
   - **Lesson**: Exploring cybersecurity principles and responsible online behavior.
   - **SEL Focus**: Foster responsibility and ethical behavior.
   - **Example Activity**: Students create a "Digital Citizenship Pledge," reflecting on responsibilities.

## Algorithmic Bias and Fairness (Critical Thinking, Empathy)
   - **Lesson**: Analyzing biases in algorithms and data.
   - **SEL Focus**: Encourage critical thinking and empathy.
   - **Example Activity**: Students analyze a dataset for biases, discussing social impacts, fostering empathy and critical thinking.
