    description: "Formative Assessments"
    preemerging: "Formative assessments are not described or do not align with the learning objectives."
    beginning: "At least one formative assessment is described, but the explanation lacks clarity on how it assesses progress towards objectives."
    progressing: "Two formative assessments are described, with some explanation of how they assess progress towards objectives."
    proficient: "Two or more formative assessments are thoroughly described, with clear explanations of how they assess progress towards objectives."

For this assignment, you will develop a comprehensive assessment plan for your chosen lesson topic. This will include creating a rubric, contract grading specifications, and an overview of your formative and summative assessments.

## Instructions

1. Choose a lesson topic and draft learning objectives. These can align with your chosen lesson topic throughout the semester. Make sure your objectives cover multiple levels of Bloom's Taxonomy.

2. Describe at least 2 formative assessments you will use during the lesson. Explain how they will assess progress towards objectives.

3. Explain your plan for the summative assessment. How will it comprehensively assess the learning objectives?

4. Create one or more rubrics that aligns with your learning objectives. The rubric should have 3-5 criteria with graduated performance descriptors.

5. Develop one or more contract grading specifications that outline requirements for A, B, C, and D grades. Specifications should be based on meeting objectives from your rubric.

You should have at least one rubric or contract grading specification for each assessment you plan.  Your assessments should cover all of your learning objectives.  You should have at least one rubric and at least one contract specification.

## Submission

Submit your entire assessment plan as a single report document.
