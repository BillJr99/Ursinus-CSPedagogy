    description: "Clarity of Learning Objectives"
    preemerging: "Learning objectives are missing or unclear."
    beginning: "Learning objectives are present but lack specificity or alignment with the chosen computing concept."
    progressing: "Learning objectives are clear and somewhat aligned with the chosen computing concept."
    proficient: "Learning objectives are clear, specific, and well-aligned with the chosen computing concept."
  - weight: 25
    description: "Alignment of Activity to Concept"
    preemerging: "Activity lacks alignment with the chosen computing concept."
    beginning: "Activity shows minimal alignment with the chosen computing concept."
    progressing: "Activity shows good alignment with the chosen computing concept but may lack depth."
    proficient: "Activity shows excellent alignment with the chosen computing concept, demonstrating thoughtful integration."
  - weight: 25
    description: "Creativity and Engagement Potential of the Activity"
    preemerging: "Activity lacks creativity and is unlikely to engage students."
    beginning: "Activity shows some creativity but may not fully engage all students."
    progressing: "Activity is creative and likely to engage most students."
    proficient: "Activity is highly creative and designed to engage all students through movement and hands-on participation."

    description: "Completeness and Clarity of Lesson Plan, Depth of Reflection"
    preemerging: "Lesson plan is incomplete or unclear; reflection lacks depth."
    beginning: "Lesson plan is mostly complete but may lack clarity; reflection shows some depth but may be superficial."
    progressing: "Lesson plan is complete and mostly clear; reflection shows good depth and application of course principles."
    proficient: "Lesson plan is complete, clear, and well-organized; reflection is insightful, demonstrating deep understanding and application of course principles."

## Kinesthetic Lesson Plan Activity

### Overview
For this assignment, you will design an unplugged or kinesthetic activity to teach a computing concept of your choice. This activity should allow students to learn through movement and hands-on participation.

### Instructions
1. **Choose a computing concept** you want students to learn. This can be an abstract concept like algorithms, or a more specific skill like binary numbers.  You are encouraged to choose the lesson activity you have been developing throughout the semester.
2. **Develop a 10-15 minute unplugged activity** that teaches this concept through movement and hands-on participation. Refer to [CS Unplugged](https://csunplugged.org/en/) for inspiration.
3. **Write a complete lesson plan** for this activity. Include:
   - Learning objectives
   - Prerequisite skills/knowledge
   - Materials needed
   - Step-by-step instructions for the activity
   - Ways to make the activity accessible to all students
   - Assessment strategies (formative and/or summative)
   - Explanations for how the activity aligns to [standards](https://csteachers.org/k12standards/interactive/)
4. **Write a reflection** on the process of developing this activity. Discuss the following:
   - Why you chose this concept and activity
   - How the activity embodies principles of kinesthetic learning
   - Challenges you faced and how you overcame them
   - How you might improve the activity in the future
   - The importance of incorporating kinesthetic learning in computer science
