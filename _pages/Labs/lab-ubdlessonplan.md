# Assignment Overview
In this assignment, you will develop a lesson plan for a computing lesson concept using the Understanding by Design (UbD) framework. You will apply the principles of backward design to create a comprehensive and aligned lesson plan.

# UbD Template
Please fill in the following UbD template for your lesson plan:

## Stage 1: Identify Desired Results
- **Enduring Understandings**: What big ideas do you want students to understand?
- **Essential Questions**: What questions will guide learning and inquiry?
- **Knowledge and Skills**: What knowledge and skills will students acquire?

## Stage 2: Determine Acceptable Evidence
- **Performance Tasks**: What tasks will students perform to demonstrate understanding?
- **Other Evidence**: What other evidence will you collect to assess student learning?

## Stage 3: Plan Learning Experiences and Instruction
- **Learning Activities**: What activities and experiences will engage students in learning?
- **Materials and Resources**: What materials and resources will you use?
- **Differentiation**: How will you differentiate instruction to meet diverse learner needs?

# Instructions
- **Choose a Computing Lesson Concept**: Select a computing lesson concept that you would like to teach.
- **Fill in the UbD Template**: Use the UbD template provided to develop your lesson plan.
- **Reflect on the Process**: Write a reflection on the process of using the UbD framework, including insights, challenges, and the importance of backward design.

# Notes
- **Understanding UbD**: Familiarize yourself with the UbD framework by reading the provided materials.
- **Alignment**: Ensure that all components of your lesson plan are aligned with each other and with the desired results.
- **Creativity**: Feel free to be creative in designing engaging and meaningful learning experiences.
- **Reflection**: Reflecting on the process is a key component of this assignment. Consider what you learned and how you might apply UbD in the future.
