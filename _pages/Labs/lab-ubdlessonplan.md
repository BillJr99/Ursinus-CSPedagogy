In this assignment, you will create a comprehensive lesson plan using the Understanding by Design (UbD) template. The goal is to apply the principles of UbD effectively in designing a lesson plan. You may choose between using your lightning talk topic, or you are welcome a new topic for this lab.

## Instructions:

### Familiarize Yourself with UbD Principles:
Review the principles of Understanding by Design and become familiar with the UbD template. Understand the three stages of backward design: identifying desired results, determining acceptable evidence, and designing learning experiences.

### Choose a Topic:
Select either your lightning talk topic or a new topic of your choice. Ensure that the topic is suitable for creating a lesson plan and aligns with the scope of the assignment.

### Stage One: Identify Desired Results:
1. Clearly define the learning goals and objectives for the lesson. Consider what you want students to know, understand, and be able to do by the end of the lesson.
2. Determine the essential questions that will guide the learning process and encourage critical thinking.
3. Identify the knowledge and skills students should master during the lesson.

### Stage Two: Determine Acceptable Evidence:
1. Decide on the assessments or evidence that will demonstrate student achievement of the desired results. Consider a variety of formative and summative assessment methods.
2. Define the criteria for evaluating student performance and understanding.

### Stage Three: Design Learning Experiences:
1. Develop the instructional strategies, activities, and materials that will engage students and facilitate their learning.
2. Ensure that the learning experiences are aligned with the desired results and provide opportunities for students to meet the assessment criteria.
3. Incorporate differentiation strategies to address the diverse needs of learners.

### Complete the UbD Template:
Utilize the [Understanding by Design template](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/Backward-Design-Template-with-Descriptions.docx) (shown below) to organize and structure your lesson plan. Include all the necessary components in each stage, such as learning goals, essential questions, assessments, instructional strategies, and materials.

### Submission:
Submit your completed UbD lesson plan.
