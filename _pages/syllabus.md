  course_description: "This course is a collaborative service-learning effort among students with an interest in computing and in education.  The course is intended to prepare pre-service teachers for certification in K-12 Computer Science in Pennsylvania, and to provide students with a research-based background in science communication and pedagogy.  We explore unique aspects of educational design in a computing environment, as well as current challenges, trends, and opportunities in computing education.  Particular emphasis will center upon equitable computing pedagogy and practice, and creating a classroom environment that is inclusive of diverse learning needs, culturally relevant, and learner-centric.  Students will design educational activities according to pedagogical best practices, and work with K-12 teachers at local schools to deliver and assess those educational materials.  Students will collectively create a portfolio of open-source curricular materials for teaching computing in the K-12 classroom for subsequent adoption and revision."
  questions: |
    Specifically, we will collectively consider questions like:
    <ul>
    <li>How can we teach computing concepts equitably to a class with widely heterogeneous prior experiences?</li>
    <li>How can we make computing activities culturally relevant?</li>
    <li>How can we make computing accessible and inclusive?</li>
    <li>How can we promote social emotional learning (SEL) through computing education?</li>
    <li>How do we design, present, and assess an effective lesson to achieve understanding through inquiry?</li>
    <li>How do we model healthy and professional collaboration in a K-12 computing classroom?</li>
    <li>What strategies promote effective student engagement in a computing class?</li>
    <li>How do we effectively democratize computing skills across all disciplines and for all learners?</li>
    <li>How can we bridge computing across K-12 disciplines through the lens of human-centric design thinking?</li>
    </ul>

  flexible_submission_policy: "In the absence of <a href=\"#accommodations\">accommodations</a> arranged in advance with the instructor or college, all assignments are due at 10:59PM Eastern Time on the date(s) stated on the schedule.  Assignments will be accepted without prior permission following this time with a points deduction of 4% per day if submitted before 10:59 PM Eastern Time on the day submitted.  Each student will receive a total of 10 &quot;slack days&quot; for the semester with which to waive these grade reductions; for example, one assignment may be submitted 10 days late, or two assignments may be submitted 5 days late, with no grade reduction.  Extra credit will not be awarded for assignments submitted under the flexible submission policy.  Students with accommodations will receive additional &quot;slack days&quot; as specified within the accommodations letter; however, some deliverables cannot be subject to accommodations due to the time-sensitive nature of the assignment (for example, group assignments, presentations, and course surveys).  Students who add the class late shall receive additional slack days equal to the number of days between the start of classes and the first date that approval is given or that class is attended (whichever occurs first).  Under no circumstances (including accommodations) can late work be accepted after the final class meeting, nor during final exams week, nor after the exam."

## Overview 

Welcome to our Computer Science Pedagogy class!

This course was inspired by a partnership between the instructor and the Pennsylvania Department of Education, in collaboration with the Montgomery County Intermediate Unit (MCIU).  We will collaborate together and with local in the development of K-12 computing curriculum and in the development of computing skills needed to teach both computer science and instructional technology across the disciplines.

We will partner across disciplines (i.e., computing students will work with education students) to further develop your technical knowledge through a teaching lens.  We will explore the unique nuances of computing pedagogy in the context of classical educational theory.  As a service-learning course, students will work with K-12 teachers in the county to develop and present their developed lessons in the classroom setting.  This will qualify as field experience time for students seeking a teaching certification through the Education department here at Ursinus.  In addition, we will assess, refine, and make publicly available all developed lesson materials.

A key ingredient of this course is the intended blending of the audience between STEM and education students.  It is my goal that a foundation in education and a foundation in computing will be attained, in part, by organic collaboration between students who are becoming experts in technology with students who are becoming experts in teaching.  The course will focus on the unique opportunities in blending and applying computing in education (and vice-versa), and in doing so, will yield opportunities for students to share with one another, and to benefit from one another.

Students in both education and computing will be encouraged to look beyond their "home" discipline.  For example, computing students will reflect upon the role Computer Science plays across other disciplines such as the arts, humanities, and sciences.  Similarly, education students will look more deeply at their targeted subject area to consider how technology can enhance the teaching and learning of their field.  Each will creatively and collaboratively develop materials to showcase and celebrate these connections, and then deliver those materials in a K-12 setting.  This course is designed to be inherently multidisciplinary, bridging pedagogy and computing in order to a) facilitate the development and delivery of technical curriculum across K-12 subjects to aid in the preparation of all pre-service teacher education students, b) enable certification in grades 7-12 computer science for pre-service teacher education students, and c) provide a foundation in education and technical communication for STEM students.  To ensure that these bridge connections are made explicit, students will reflect upon their partnership with their classmates and with their participating teacher(s) throughout the semester.  In addition to the collaborative development and delivery of curricular modules, students will be asked to reflect in writing and in synchronous and/or asynchronous class discussions upon their experiences in working with their classroom counterparts (i.e., CS students working with Education students, and vice-versa), and with their partner teachers.  These discussions will be framed through guided questions that students will be asked to consider before class, and be prepared to discuss during class.
