  course_description: "This course is a collaborative service-learning effort among students with an interest in computing and in education.  The course is intended to prepare pre-service teachers for certification in K-12 Computer Science in Pennsylvania, and to provide students with a research-based background in science communication and pedagogy.  We explore unique aspects of educational design in a computing environment, as well as current challenges, trends, and opportunities in computing education.  Particular emphasis will center upon equitable computing pedagogy and practice, and creating a classroom environment that is inclusive of diverse learning needs, culturally relevant, and learner-centric.  Students will design educational activities according to pedagogical best practices, and work with K-12 teachers at local schools to deliver and assess those educational materials.  Students will collectively create a portfolio of open-source curricular materials for teaching computing in the K-12 classroom for subsequent adoption and revision."
  questions: |
    Specifically, we will collectively consider questions like:
    <ul>
    <li>How can we teach computing concepts equitably to a class with widely heterogeneous prior experiences?</li>
    <li>How can we make computing activities culturally relevant?</li>
    <li>How can we make computing accessible and inclusive?</li>
    <li>How can we promote social emotional learning (SEL) through computing education?</li>
    <li>How do we design, present, and assess an effective lesson to achieve understanding through inquiry?</li>
    <li>How do we model healthy and professional collaboration in a K-12 computing classroom?</li>
    <li>What strategies promote effective student engagement in a computing class?</li>
    </ul>

  flexible_submission_policy: "In the absence of <a href=\"#accommodations\">accommodations</a> arranged in advance with the instructor or college, all assignments are due at 10:59PM Eastern Time on the date(s) stated on the schedule.  Assignments will be accepted without prior permission following this time with a points deduction of 4% per day if submitted before 10:59 PM Eastern Time on the day submitted.  Each student will receive a total of 10 &quot;slack days&quot; for the semester with which to waive these grade reductions; for example, one assignment may be submitted 10 days late, or two assignments may be submitted 5 days late, with no grade reduction.  Extra credit will not be awarded for assignments submitted under the flexible submission policy.  Students with accommodations will receive additional &quot;slack days&quot; as specified within the accommodations letter; however, some deliverables cannot be subject to accommodations due to the time-sensitive nature of the assignment (for example, group assignments, presentations, and course surveys).  Students who add the class late shall receive additional slack days equal to the number of days between the start of classes and the first date that approval is given or that class is attended (whichever occurs first).  Under no circumstances (including accommodations) can late work be accepted after the final class meeting, nor during final exams week, nor after the exam."

## Overview
Computer Networks study interconnected computing systems at scale from many different perspectives.  Moving a bit from one computer to another over the Internet is a [complex process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BGWrLiT9qs).  The bit must travel to its destination from one computer to another, which must have some way of knowing where that bit is trying to go so that it can be moved along the right path.  Wireless communications (and even wired connections) are subject to noise and interference that may corrupt the bit as it transits between any two of those computers.  We need ways to manage these destination addresses, optimal pathways, and mechanisms to detect corrupted messages.  Sometimes, computers might become too overworked to forward your message, and they can be lost: worse yet, we cannot communicate this situation back to the sender (after all, if we had the resources to do so, we could have just forwarded the message properly!).  The sender, then, needs a way to ensure that their message was received, and received in-tact.  Ideally, we would do so efficiently: if new, faster paths to the destination appear (sort of like new expressways on the interstate highway system), we'd like to find out about them and utilize them, traffic permitting.  Even then, we need to define what those bits represent: an e-mail, a webpage, a function call, or data like a shopping cart.  And beyond all this, we need a mechanism to enable these communications to occur privately and securely: we want to ensure that the sender and receiver can validate one another's identity and privilege.  To facilitate all of this, we organize the study of computer networks into a "layered" model, in which we investigate each of these concepts independently of the others.  In fact, networks are implemented according to this layered model, which greatly simplifies the apparent complexity of the network as a whole: we implement an independent algorithm for each concept, and they interact only as much as is required (typically, only with one or two neighboring algorithms, which, in turn interact with their immediately adjacent layers).  

## Homework

### Labs
Every week, we will have a lab session where students get a chance to practice concepts we just learned in a safe and [collaborative](#collaboration) environment. Tasks will be given that serve as warm-ups for the larger assignments, and final submissions will be graded on a scale from 0 to 2. Students will have a chance to refine their submissions until the Friday of every week, and there will be help from the Lab T.A.s listed above.

### Assignments
The bulk of the grade in the course will be earned by completing individual programming assignments. Be sure to start them early! Note that [collaboration and sharing rules](#collaboration) differ slightly for labs and assignments.

## Classroom Participation

### Group Work \[[^1]\]
In addition to ordinary participation that follows the natural rhythm of a lecture, most days there will be at least one followup problem, which is a question that follows on the heels of newly presented material. Students will split into groups of 2 and try to write some code to address a particular problem. When a group of students believe they have figured out the answer, they raise their hand. The other students can continue to work while I verify that the answer is correct. If the answer is correct, the students present the answer to the class. If the group is not correct upon my checking, then the groups continue this process until one gets it correct.

Other ways to help your fellow classmates in class are as follows:

* Helping to teach a student a topic during office hours.
* Certain calls for participation in class
* Particularly helpful or insightful messages on Microsoft Teams
* Finding mistakes in the book or on the assigned homework and labs

### Class Participation and Classroom Etiquette \[[^1]\]
For classroom attendance, the following rules apply:

* Please be attentive during class. There will be class exercises that involve coding, but class time should be used for learning computer science. It is imperative that technology be used for this purpose during our class time together. **Alternatively, please try to think of this as a safe space away from social media.** We could all use a break, and we are fortunate to have a good excuse to make that space.
* Please follow common courtesy. For instance, you can bring food and drink as long as it's not distracting, but please clean up after yourself if you do. Our janitorial staff deserves the utmost respect and help with their job.
* In-class exercises and "low stakes" activities will take place individually and in groups to assess our progress together.  These exercises will be given both synchronously (for example, in-class activities, pair programming exercises) and asynchronously (for example, pre-lab exercises, peer code reviews, book surveys) and will be graded on a participation basis.  These are given equal weight and form the basis of the class participation score.
* If a class session is remote, please feel free to make choices that make you most comfortable.  For example, I will record these sessions for students who cannot make the session or for those who would benefit from a review of the material.  I'd encourage you to enable your video feed if it is available, but if you need leave your video off, you feel free to do so; however, if you find that this becomes necessary on a prolonged basis, please see me to discuss.  Please keep your microphone on mute to avoid background noises while others are speaking; however, please do not feel "mic fright" about unmuting to speak up and participate anytime.  If, however, you would prefer to communicate via the chat interface (either exclusively or in combination with your audio/video), you should feel free to do that.  Whether in-person or remote, all I ask is that you engage as best you can; the material is challenging but fun, and we're all here to learn new things together.
