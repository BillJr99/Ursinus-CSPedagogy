In this project, you will propose a topic of your choosing and a group of at least 2 and up to 4 total members.  The project must be approved by the instructor before it may commence, but the topic is entirely up to you.  

This open-ended project aims to give you space to explore computing and its applications in a context that you're passionate about.  The full capability of computing to benefit others is realized when it is applied to domains of human need.  We will focus on ideas that can be carried out in a K-12 classroom or in a K-12 extracurricular activity (such as a club event or hackathon).  A theme of this project is to expand your view of computing and its capabilities in service to others.  There are perhaps endless ways of doing this.  Here are some examples:

* Designing a lesson plan for K-12 students to get exposed to computing in an area related to your major (or other interest!).  
* Identifying an existing K-12 lesson in partnership with a local teacher, and revising it to employ a targeted pedagogy practice such as [POGIL](https://cspogil.org/Home) or [Universal Design for Learning (UDL)](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/).

## Group Formation and Proposal 

To form a group, students should draft a text document including the names of all students in the group, a summary of the proposed project, and a breakdown of each student's responsibilities on the team.  **Each student** should send this identical document to me for approval via e-mail.  I will respond via e-mail to the **entire** group notifying them that the project has been approved, and which members are on the team.  If I add or remove members from the team, I will notify the entire group via e-mail.  This shall constitute agreement of the project responsibilities by all members of the team.

## Deployment

Your final product should be suitable for use by someone that is not in your group currently.  Think carefully about what that person might need to know, or might need to have, to complete your project or teach it to their class!  Take notes as you prototype your project, and you will have a good inventory that you can easily refer to at the end for this purpose.

## K-12 Presentation

You will present your module in a K-12 classroom (or extracurricular) setting under the supervision of your instructor and/or a partner K-12 teacher.  You will receive feedback and guidance from both your instructor and your partner teacher.  Each individual in the group should write a reflection on this feedback and on what you observed in the classroom.  How did it go?  What went according to plan?  Did you have to alter any of your plans on the fly?  If you were to create a "version 2.0" of this project for someone next year, what would you suggest that they do differently, or what would you revise?

## Bridging Disciplines through Design Thinking

In this project, you are encouraged to break out of your comfort zone to explore STEM and computing education in a broad context.  For example, if you are a Computer Science major, you might consider a lesson in computing that uses a POGIL or Unplugged model, or how you might use these pedagogical approaches in a corporate or lifelong education environment, or in a science communication context.  If you are an Education major, you might consider how computing education can enhance the teaching and learning of a concept in computer science, or how a computing idea can permeate a social studies or humanities lesson, or one in the arts.

Whether you are an Education student, a STEM/CS student, or another major, a common theme that connects the development and communication of computing curriculum is the human-in-the-loop.  A major goal of computing is to create solutions that enhance the lives of those who use it, and a goal of learning computing is to become aware of not only the technical skills that surround creating those solutions, but in identifying the diverse needs of the people who will interact with those systems.  

In your report and class presentation, you will present not only your lesson, its deployment, your assessment, and future recommendations, but you will also reflect upon how your own view of computing and education have changed as a result of collaborating with your classmates and supervising teachers.  To guide this discussion, consider and include your responses to the following guided questions, through the lens of the lesson or activity you developed for this project:

1. Has design thinking changed the way you look at everyday things?
2. What are some examples of outcomes in design that would benefit from a more holistic stakeholder design experience, and how might you lead a class of learners (in any subject) in a discussion about human-centric design?
3. How might design thinking be incorporated into your own subject area?
4. How might you transform an "ordinary" classroom activity to use guided inquiry and discovery processes such as those found within design thinking?
5. What kinds of community partnerships would be helpful to facilitate authentic design thinking activities or service learning for your students?

## First Draft 

It is best if one's first draft is not also the final draft, especially as your ideas evolve with your own understanding and from feedback from others.  The first draft is an opportunity to write your ideas: concentrate on your message, rather than the structure of your narrative.  How do you want your readers to change after having read your work?  What contribution are you hoping to make?  Don't worry if it's not entirely clear in this draft, or if the organization isn't perfect.  At this stage, you are developing your raw materials - the clay from which you'll mold a cohesive thesis later.

## Final Draft 

It is **highly recommended** that you review your first draft with a [Writing Fellow from the Writing and Speaking Center](https://www.ursinus.edu/offices/center-for-writing-and-speaking/).  Based on this feedback and the feedback from your instructor (and possibly from classmates), revise your report into a final draft.  

## Class Presentation

Finally, you will present a summary of your project to our class, and summarize your experience and reflections during the experience.

## Unit and Lesson Activities

Your final report will include the complete unit and lesson activities you developed throughout the semester.  Consider this your portfolio!  I encourage you to publish this publicly.  Your design should include a unit of at least 3 lessons that includes (and discusses explicitly) several of the 12 pedagogical principles of computing, along with formative and summative assessments that span Bloom's taxonomy, and whose lesson activities differentiate instruction using scaffolding of multiple entry points according to UDL principles.
