In this project, you will propose a topic of your choosing and a group of at least 2 and up to 4 total members.  The project must be approved by the instructor before it may commence, but the topic is entirely up to you.  

This open-ended project aims to give you space to explore computing and its applications in a context that you're passionate about.  The full capability of computing to benefit others is realized when it is applied to domains of human need.  We will focus on ideas that can be carried out in a K-12 classroom or in a K-12 extracurricular activity (such as a club event or hackathon).  A theme of this project is to expand your view of computing and its capabilities in service to others.  There are perhaps endless ways of doing this.  Here are some examples:

* Designing a lesson plan for K-12 students to get exposed to computing in an area related to your major (or other interest!).  
* Identifying an existing K-12 lesson in partnership with a local teacher, and revising it to employ a targeted pedagogy practice such as [POGIL](https://cspogil.org/Home) or [Universal Design for Learning (UDL)](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/).
* Develop a "hardware or software hack" that solves a practical problem, and develop it into a unit of modules for a CS classroom.  Here are a few specific (but not limiting) examples:
  * Collecting and analyzing local environmental data using a computing statistical package
  * Writing a program to predict modeled behavior in physics (like an object in free-fall), and calculating the percentage error from the theoretical model in practice.
  * Using a computing system to assist in the generation of music for beginners by suggesting chord progressions and other theoretical elements.
  * Using a human-centric approach to design an algorithm that replicates an "Air Tag" by playing "hide and seek" with radios.
  * Conducting statistical analysis to determine authorship of the Federalist Papers for a Social Studies class.

## Group Formation and Proposal 

To form a group, students should draft a text document including the names of all students in the group, a summary of the proposed project, and a breakdown of each student's responsibilities on the team.  **Each student** should send this identical document to me for approval via e-mail.  I will respond via e-mail to the **entire** group notifying them that the project has been approved, and which members are on the team.  If I add or remove members from the team, I will notify the entire group via e-mail.  This shall constitute agreement of the project responsibilities by all members of the team.

## First Draft 

It is best if one's first draft is not also the final draft, especially as your ideas evolve with your own understanding and from feedback from others.  The first draft is an opportunity to write your ideas: concentrate on your message, rather than the structure of your narrative.  How do you want your readers to change after having read your work?  What contribution are you hoping to make?  Don't worry if it's not entirely clear in this draft, or if the organization isn't perfect.  At this stage, you are developing your raw materials - the clay from which you'll mold a cohesive thesis later.

## Final Draft 

It is **highly recommended** that you review your first draft with a [Writing Fellow from the Writing and Speaking Center](https://www.ursinus.edu/offices/center-for-writing-and-speaking/).  Based on this feedback and the feedback from your instructor (and possibly from classmates), revise your report into a final draft.  

## Deployment

Your final product should be suitable for use by someone that is not in your group currently.  Think carefully about what that person might need to know, or might need to have, to complete your project or teach it to their class!  Take notes as you prototype your project, and you will have a good inventory that you can easily refer to at the end for this purpose.

## Class Presentation

You will present your module in a K-12 classroom (or extracurricular) setting under the supervision of your instructor and/or a partner K-12 teacher.  You will receive feedback and guidance from both your instructor and your partner teacher.  Each individual in the group should write a reflection on this feedback and on what you observed in the classroom.  How did it go?  What went according to plan?  Did you have to alter any of your plans on the fly?  If you were to create a "version 2.0" of this project for someone next year, what would you suggest that they do differently, or what would you revise?
