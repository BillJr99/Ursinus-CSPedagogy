# Introduction
In this assignment, you will propose and complete a computing hackathon project using devices like Arduino or micro:bit. Your team will then develop a presentation to teach other students how to design and implement your project.

# Project Ideas
* Develop a "hardware or software hack" that solves a practical problem, and develop it into a unit of modules for a CS classroom.  Here are a few specific (but not limiting) examples:
  - **Light Control System**: Design a system to control lights using Arduino, with features like dimming, color changing, and scheduling.
  - **Radio Communication**: Build a simple radio communication system using micro:bit to send and receive messages.
  - **Weather Station**: Create a weather monitoring station that collects and displays data using sensors connected to Arduino.
  - **Smart Plant Care System**: Develop a plant care system that monitors soil moisture and controls watering using micro:bit.
  - **Digital Signature Podcast Projects**: Implement and enhance a project featured on the Digital Signature Podcast.
  - **Environmental Data Analysis**: Collecting and analyzing local environmental data using a computing statistical package.  As a proof-of-concept the micro:bit can be used as a hygrometer to monitor soil moisture levels.
  - **Scientific Simulation**: Writing a program to predict modeled behavior in physics (like an object in free-fall), and calculating the percentage error from the theoretical model in practice.
  - **Sound Generation**: Using a computing system to assist in the generation of music for beginners by suggesting chord progressions and other theoretical elements.
  - **Finding Lost Items**: Using a human-centric approach to design an algorithm that replicates an "Air Tag" by playing "hide and seek" with radios.
  - **Text Analysis**: Conducting statistical analysis to determine authorship of the Federalist Papers for a Social Studies class.

# What to Do
1. **Form a Team**: Collaborate with your peers to form a team.
2. **Choose a Project**: Select one of the provided ideas or propose your own.
3. **Develop a Proposal**: Write a proposal detailing your project's goals, design, and implementation plan.
4. **Implement the Project**: Work as a team to build your project.
5. **Create a Presentation**: Develop a presentation to teach the design and implementation of your project.
6. **Present to the Class**: Present your project and teaching materials to the class.

# Evaluation
Your project and presentation will be evaluated based on the design, implementation, educational value, teamwork, and project management. Please refer to the rubric for specific criteria.

# Reflection
Reflect on this project experience. How did it enhance your understanding of computing and pedagogy? What were the challenges, and how did you overcome them? What insights did you gain about teamwork and project management?  What would you do differently next time, and how can you incorporate these lessons learned into your own classroom environment?
