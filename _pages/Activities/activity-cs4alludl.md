## CS4All: UDL for Inclusive Computing Pedagogy
CS4All is an initiative that aims to bring computer science education to all students, promoting inclusivity in computing pedagogy. One of the key concepts in achieving inclusive education is Universal Design for Learning (UDL). UDL provides a framework for designing instructional materials and activities that meet the diverse needs of learners. We will explore how UDL can be applied to differentiate instruction in computer science, ensuring that all learners can access and succeed in CS education.
