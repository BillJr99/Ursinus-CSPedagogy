## SEL in Computing Education

Social-emotional learning (SEL) refers to the process of acquiring and applying the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to understand and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, show empathy for others, establish and maintain positive relationships, and make responsible decisions. In the context of computing education, incorporating SEL not only enhances students' computational thinking skills but also promotes their overall well-being and success. We explore the importance of SEL in computing education and provides examples of how it can be integrated into teaching practices.

## Importance of SEL in Computing Education

### Incorporating Computational Thinking as an SEL Experience

According to the reading "Make Computational Thinking a Social-Emotional Learning Experience" by Learning.com [^1], computational thinking can be integrated into SEL experiences. By emphasizing problem-solving, critical thinking, and decision-making skills in a collaborative, supportive, and inclusive environment, students can develop not only their technical skills but also their social and emotional skills. The article suggests that teachers can facilitate this integration by encouraging students to work in groups, engage in discussions, and reflect on their problem-solving approaches. Additionally, teachers can incorporate SEL prompts, questions, or scenarios into coding activities to foster empathy, perspective-taking, and ethical decision-making.

### SEL in a CS Environment

The reading "Importance of SEL in a CS Environment" by the Computer Science Teachers Association's Equity Initiative [^2] highlights the significance of incorporating SEL in the computer science (CS) classroom. The article emphasizes that SEL skills such as self-awareness, self-regulation, social awareness, relationship-building, and responsible decision-making are essential for both academic and personal success. It further emphasizes the importance of supportive learning environments, empathetic teaching practices, and fostering a sense of belonging among students. By nurturing SEL skills, CS educators can create inclusive, collaborative, and empowering learning spaces that empower students to persist, overcome challenges, and thrive in the field of computer science.

This literature review explores the existing research on the incorporation of social-emotional learning in computer science education. The authors summarize key findings related to the impact of SEL on student motivation, engagement, academic performance, and well-being. The review also identifies effective pedagogical approaches and strategies for integrating SEL into computer science classrooms. Python examples in teaching coding concepts are discussed as a means of integrating SEL and computational thinking.

### 3. Title: "Promoting SEL through Collaborative Game Design in CS Education"
- Authors: Chen, J., & Michaelis, J.
- Published: 2018
- Source: ACM Transactions on Computing Education

This research paper investigates the impact of collaborative game design projects on promoting SEL skills in CS education. The authors argue that game design provides an ideal context for developing computational thinking and SEL skills simultaneously. The study proposes a project-based learning approach that incorporates game design as a means of fostering collaboration, communication, problem-solving, and empathy. Python can be used as a programming language in the context of game design projects to enhance students' SEL skills.

## Conclusion

Incorporating social-emotional learning (SEL) in computing education is essential for fostering holistic development among students. By integrating computational thinking into SEL experiences and creating supportive learning environments, educators can enhance students' technical skills and promote their social and emotional well-being. Various research articles suggest that integrating SEL and computational thinking can lead to improved problem-solving, empathy, ethical decision-making, motivation, and academic performance.
