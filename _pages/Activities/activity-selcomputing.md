## SEL in Computing Education

Social-emotional learning (SEL) refers to the process of acquiring and applying the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to understand and manage emotions, set and achieve positive goals, show empathy for others, establish and maintain positive relationships, and make responsible decisions. In the context of computing education, incorporating SEL not only enhances students' computational thinking skills but also promotes their overall well-being and success. We explore the importance of SEL in computing education and provides examples of how it can be integrated into teaching practices.

## Importance of SEL in Computing Education

### Incorporating Computational Thinking as an SEL Experience

According to the reading "Make Computational Thinking a Social-Emotional Learning Experience" by Learning.com [^1], computational thinking can be integrated into SEL experiences. By emphasizing problem-solving, critical thinking, and decision-making skills in a collaborative, supportive, and inclusive environment, students can develop not only their technical skills but also their social and emotional skills. The article suggests that teachers can facilitate this integration by encouraging students to work in groups, engage in discussions, and reflect on their problem-solving approaches. Additionally, teachers can incorporate SEL prompts, questions, or scenarios into coding activities to foster empathy, perspective-taking, and ethical decision-making.

### SEL in a CS Environment

The reading "Importance of SEL in a CS Environment" by the Computer Science Teachers Association's Equity Initiative [^2] highlights the significance of incorporating SEL in the computer science (CS) classroom. The article emphasizes that SEL skills such as self-awareness, self-regulation, social awareness, relationship-building, and responsible decision-making are essential for both academic and personal success. It further emphasizes the importance of supportive learning environments, empathetic teaching practices, and fostering a sense of belonging among students. By nurturing SEL skills, CS educators can create inclusive, collaborative, and empowering learning spaces that empower students to persist, overcome challenges, and thrive in the field of computer science.

## Conclusion

Incorporating social-emotional learning (SEL) in computing education is essential for fostering holistic development among students. By integrating computational thinking into SEL experiences and creating supportive learning environments, educators can enhance students' technical skills and promote their social and emotional well-being. Various research articles suggest that integrating SEL and computational thinking can lead to improved problem-solving, empathy, ethical decision-making, motivation, and academic performance.
