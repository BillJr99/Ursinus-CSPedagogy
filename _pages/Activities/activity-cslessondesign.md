### Lesson 1: Kinesthetic Activity

#### Stage 1: Desired Results
- **Understanding Goals**: Students will understand the concept of partitioning in the quicksort algorithm.
- **Essential Questions**: How does partitioning work in quicksort? How can we physically represent the sorting process?

#### Stage 2: Evidence
- **Performance Tasks**: Students will physically arrange themselves or objects to represent the partitioning process.
- **Other Evidence**: Observation of student participation, group discussion.

#### Stage 3: Learning Plan
- **Introduction**: Explain the quicksort algorithm and the importance of partitioning.
- **Activity**: Divide students into groups and give each group a set of numbered cards. Instruct them to perform the quicksort algorithm physically by arranging themselves or the cards.
- **Discussion**: Facilitate a discussion about their experiences and observations.
- **Closure**: Summarize the key concepts of partitioning in quicksort.

### Lesson 2: POGIL (Process-Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning) Activity

#### Stage 1: Desired Results
- **Understanding Goals**: Students will understand the recursive nature of quicksort.
- **Essential Questions**: How does recursion work in quicksort? How can we analyze its efficiency?

#### Stage 2: Evidence
- **Performance Tasks**: Students will work in teams to complete guided inquiry worksheets.
- **Other Evidence**: Written responses, group presentations.

#### Stage 3: Learning Plan
- **Introduction**: Introduce recursion and its role in quicksort.
- **Activity**: Provide worksheets with guided questions for students to explore in groups.
- **Discussion**: Have groups present their findings and facilitate a class discussion.
- **Closure**: Summarize the recursive nature and efficiency of quicksort.

### Lesson 3: Algorithm Design Activity

#### Stage 1: Desired Results
- **Understanding Goals**: Students will understand how to design and analyze the quicksort algorithm.
- **Essential Questions**: How is quicksort designed? What are the key components?

#### Stage 2: Evidence
- **Performance Tasks**: Students will design a flowchart or pseudocode for quicksort.
- **Other Evidence**: Peer review, class discussion.

#### Stage 3: Learning Plan
- **Introduction**: Explain the components of quicksort.
- **Activity**: Instruct students to create a flowchart or write pseudocode for quicksort.
- **Discussion**: Facilitate a discussion on different design approaches.
- **Closure**: Summarize the key design principles of quicksort.

### Lesson 4: Coding Activity

#### Stage 1: Desired Results
- **Understanding Goals**: Students will understand how to implement quicksort in code.
- **Essential Questions**: How can we translate the quicksort algorithm into code?

#### Stage 2: Evidence
- **Performance Tasks**: Students will write code to implement quicksort.
- **Other Evidence**: Code review, execution of code.

#### Stage 3: Learning Plan
- **Introduction**: Introduce the coding environment and language syntax.
- **Activity**: Guide students through coding the quicksort algorithm, allowing them to write and test their code.
- **Discussion**: Discuss common coding challenges and solutions.
- **Closure**: Summarize the coding principles applied in implementing quicksort.

These lesson plans provide a comprehensive approach to teaching the quicksort algorithm, engaging students through physical activity, guided inquiry, design thinking, and coding practice. The unit is designed to build progressively, ensuring that students gain a deep and thorough understanding of the subject matter.
