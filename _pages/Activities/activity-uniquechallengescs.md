## Unique Challenges in CS Pedagogy

Computer Science (CS) pedagogy involves unique challenges that educators must address to ensure an inclusive and effective learning environment. We will explore these challenges and proposes strategies to promote equity and inclusivity in CS classrooms.

### Achieving a Differentiated Computer Science Classroom: An Approach to Promote Equity

Differentiated instruction is not unique to Computer Science, but the creative nature of computing activities makes this approach particularly useful to allow students multiple pathways of entry to engage with the material.

The article "Achieving a Differentiated Computer Science Classroom: An Approach to Promote Equity" presents a framework for implementing differentiated instruction in CS classrooms to address the diverse needs and backgrounds of students. Differentiation allows educators to tailor their teaching methods and materials to individual students, promoting equitable access to CS education.

In a differentiated CS classroom, educators may vary the pace of instruction, provide alternative assessments, and offer multiple learning pathways. For example, educators can offer both visual and auditory explanations of concepts, use varied coding platforms, and encourage collaborative learning.

#### The Problems with Differentiating Computer Science
The article begins by identifying the unique challenges faced by teachers in providing differentiated education in computer science classrooms. These challenges include the strict and unforgiving nature of coding, the diverse range of students' coding abilities, and the need to cater to students with different educational requirements. The authors emphasize the importance of differentiation to ensure equitable access to computer science education for all students, regardless of their background.

##### Example: Binary Numbers

Here are some ways a teacher can differentiate binary number instruction:

* For novice students, start with tangible real-world examples of binary encoding. Have students try encoding simple text messages or their names using a system of two symbols like dots and dashes. Then bridge this to how computers use 1s and 0s as binary digits.

* For students with some prior knowledge, provide a brief overview of binary, but then move quickly to practice problems. Challenge them to convert back and forth between binary and decimal numbers. Offer more advanced problems like binary addition.

* For very experienced students, let them teach binary numbers to other students. Have them create presentations, videos, or other instructional materials to help their less experienced peers understand binaries.

* For all students, use a variety of tactile and visual activities like flipping coins, coding playing cards, or color coding 0s and 1s. This engages different learning styles.

* Pair students and have them peer teach each other about binary numbers. This allows students to reinforce their own learning while supporting others.

##### Example: Algorithms

* Provide flowchart templates with some steps already filled in to help struggling students.
* Let advanced students design their own complex algorithms to solve real-world problems.
* Use different objects like beads or tiles to represent sequence and repetition for visual learners.

##### Example: Programming

* Offer code snippets to drag and drop instead of writing syntax from scratch.
* Encourage experienced students to build on basic code examples by adding parameters, loops, etc.
* Use pair programming where students work together to explain code to one another.

##### Example: Data Structures

* Struggling students can use visual diagrams and models before coding abstract data structures.
* Advanced students can explain pros and cons of different data structures for various problems.
* Use real-world examples like organizing books in a library to explain abstract concepts.

#### Depth of Knowledge Scaffolding
The article introduces the concept of "Depth of Knowledge Scaffolding" as a solution to the problem of differentiating computer science education. This approach avoids splitting students into tracking groups and instead uses a heterogeneous whole-class approach. Five levels of scaffolding differentiation are provided, based on Norman Webb's Depth of Knowledge framework. These levels allow students to learn and practice the same topics with varying degrees of depth, support, and challenge.

##### Example: Assisting with Syntax
The authors discuss the high barrier of entry in computer science due to the need for precise syntax and the challenges of keyboard typing. They present a solution through Scaffolding Level 1, where students are given starter code and detailed comments. This approach, combined with a code-writing helper called Code Assist, enables students to practice code recall and learn concepts without needing to memorize complex syntax.

##### Example: Sorting Algorithms

Here are some examples of scaffolding that a teacher could provide when assigning students to implement a classic sorting algorithm like merge sort or quicksort:

* Provide students with pseudocode for the algorithm that outlines the overall steps at a high level without detailing the programming logic. Students then translate this into actual code.

* Give students starter code that includes the function signatures and declarations needed to implement the algorithm. Students fill in the logic line-by-line.

* For visual learners, show a flow chart or visualization of how the algorithm works. Students use this to guide their code.

* Break the implementation down into discrete steps and have students tackle one part at a time. First focus just on the logic to merge two sorted arrays, before writing the full recursive merge sort.

* Model the process of walking through the algorithm logically on a small example input, explaining each step. Ask students to do the same on their own with other inputs.

* Provide comments in the code stubs denoting where key loops, comparisons, and function calls need to be added by the student.

* Give struggling students the complete code with errors for them to debug and correct, rather than creating from scratch.

* Allow pairing students up to work collaboratively to implement the algorithm.

* Offer code reviews and feedback at regular check-ins before students submit their final working program.

The goal is to provide just enough support to help students get started and work through the key steps on their own. Scaffolding gives students a solid foundation while still requiring their own critical thinking. Adjust the amount of scaffolding up or down based on each student's ability level.

### Scaffolding

Scaffolding is a pedagogical approach that helps students progress in their learning process by gradually removing support mechanisms as they gain proficiency. In computer science (CS) and specifically Python programming, it's about providing students with initial support or 'scaffolds' that help them solve complex problems.
It is a teaching method that involves providing students with temporary support structures that help them accomplish tasks that they couldn't otherwise do. The goal is to gradually remove these supports, allowing students to perform tasks independently. It's based on Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), which refers to the range of tasks that are too difficult for students to master alone but can be mastered with guidance and assistance from a teacher or more competent peers.
Programming can be challenging for beginners due to abstract concepts and complex syntax. Scaffolding allows beginners to focus on learning concepts step by step, with less focus on the syntax. It allows students to learn and build confidence gradually, which leads to better engagement and retention.

#### Example: Partial Code

Providing partial codes allows students to understand a code structure without being overwhelmed by the entire code at once. It also encourages them to think about the remaining part of the code. For example:

```python
def greet(name):
    # TODO: Complete this function to print 'Hello, {name}!'
    pass
```

#### Example: Sorting Algorithms

Use the following code snippet as a starting point:

   ```python
   def partition(arr, low, high):
       # TODO: Choose a pivot element
       # TODO: Rearrange the elements around the pivot
       # TODO: Return the pivot index
       pass

   def quicksort(arr, low, high):
       if low < high:
           # TODO: Call the partition function
           # TODO: Recursively call quicksort on left and right subarrays
       return arr
   ```

You can also provide the following guided steps to fill in the missing details of the implementation:

   - **Partition Function**:
     - Choose a pivot element (e.g., the last element in the current subarray).
     - Rearrange the elements so that elements less than the pivot are on the left, and elements greater than the pivot are on the right.
     - Return the index of the pivot.
   - **Quicksort Function**:
     - Call the partition function to partition the current subarray.
     - Recursively call quicksort on the left and right subarrays.
   - **Testing**: Test your code with a sample list, such as `[3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]`.
  
For an intermediate activity or student group, you could provide a bit less detail in the "starter code" as shown below:

   ```python
   def partition(arr, low, high):
       # TODO: Implement the partitioning logic
       return pivot_index

   def quicksort(arr, low, high):
       # TODO: Implement the recursive calls
       return arr
   ```
