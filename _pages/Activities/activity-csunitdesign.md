info:
  goals:
    - To design a unit according to the UbD framework
    - To develop a unit of lessons that incorporate various modalities, such as kinesthetic and POGIL
    - To synthesize multiple modalities for Universal Design for Learning
  guidingquestions:
    - "In what ways could this lesson plan be improved to promote inclusivity and the 12 pedagogical principles?"
    - "Adapt your lightning talk topic into a unit plan with lessons using this template."

## Lesson Activities

### POGIL Activity

Give students a pre-written Java program that includes some functions. Have them work in small groups to analyze the program by identifying the function declarations, function calls, parameters, and return values. Students complete a guided worksheet prompting them to explain how the functions are declared, called, and used in the overall program.

### CS Unplugged Activity

Have students stand in two lines facing each other. One line represents the "calling" functions and the other line represents the "called" functions. Have the calling functions call out their function name and parameters. The corresponding called function acts out executing the function body and returning a value. Swap roles and repeat.

### Pair Programming Activity

Have students work in pairs on writing functions based on specifications you provide. One student can write function declarations while the other writes the function body. Then they can trade roles for the next function. Partners can discuss approaches and syntax. After writing the functions, have them switch computers and call each other's functions in a simple test program.

### Programming Task

Write a Java program that calculates statistics from a list of numbers. Your program should have the following functions:

* `getNumbers()` - This void function should prompt the user to input a series of numbers and store them in an array.

* `findSum()` - This function should accept the array of numbers as a parameter and return the sum of the numbers.

* `findAverage()` - This function should accept the array of numbers as a parameter and return the average of the numbers.

* `findMax()` - This function should accept the array of numbers as a parameter and return the maximum number.

* `printResults()` - This void function should print out the sum, average, and max by calling the other functions.

In the `main()` method, call `getNumbers()` to populate the array. Then call `printResults()` to output the final statistics.

## Sample Lesson Plan for Pair Programming Activity

### Lesson Plan: Collaborative Function Writing

#### Objective:
To reinforce understanding of function declarations and function bodies by working collaboratively to write and call functions based on provided specifications.

#### Duration:
45 minutes to 1 hour

#### Materials:
- Computers or laptops with programming environments installed (e.g., Python, Java, C++)
- Sample function specifications (prepared by the teacher)
- Test program template (prepared by the teacher)

#### Procedure:

##### Introduction (5 minutes)
- Begin the lesson by explaining the importance of functions in programming and how they help organize code and promote reusability.
- Briefly discuss the structure of a function, including the function declaration (header) and the function body.
- Explain that in this lesson, students will work collaboratively in pairs to write functions based on provided specifications.

##### Pairing Up (5 minutes)
- Divide the students into pairs and assign each pair a computer or laptop.
- Encourage students to work with someone they haven't partnered with before to foster collaboration and learning from each other.

##### Function Writing Activity (20 minutes)
- Provide each pair with a set of function specifications, either on a handout or projected on a screen.
- Instruct one student in each pair to write the function declarations based on the specifications, while the other student writes the function bodies.
- Explain that they should discuss their approaches and syntax with each other, ensuring they have a clear understanding of the task before writing the code.
- Encourage students to ask questions and seek clarification if needed.
- Remind them to follow the standard naming conventions and use appropriate variable names for clarity.

##### Role Switch and Function Review (10 minutes)
- After the first function is completed, instruct the students to switch roles. The student who wrote the function declaration should now write the function body, and vice versa.
- Encourage students to discuss their approaches again and provide feedback to each other on the code they've written.
- Emphasize the importance of clear communication and collaboration in the programming process.

##### Test Program (10 minutes)
- Provide the students with a test program template, which includes a simple program structure with placeholders for function calls.
- Instruct the students to switch computers with their partner and insert function calls to test the functions they wrote.
- Remind them to pay attention to the function return values and any potential errors or bugs that may arise during testing.
- Encourage students to discuss the output of their test program with their partner and troubleshoot any issues together.

##### Conclusion and Discussion (5 minutes)
- Bring the class back together for a brief discussion on the activity.
- Ask students to share their experiences and challenges encountered during the collaborative function writing process.
- Highlight the benefits of working in pairs, such as sharing ideas, learning from each other, and catching errors more effectively.
- Reinforce the importance of clear communication and teamwork in programming, as it reflects real-world collaborative coding environments.

##### Extension Activity (optional)
- As an extension, you can assign additional function specifications to pairs of students as homework.
- Encourage them to continue practicing collaborative function writing and testing independently.
