  guidingquestions:
    - "In what ways does this framework aid the instructor in planning their classroom activities?"
    - "Design a lesson plan of class activities for one or more of the activities described in the learning plan."
    - "Identify some ways that you could assess for evidence of competence in the desired goals."

      title: "The Stages of the UbD Framework"
      questions:
        - "Why do you think the UbD framework promotes &quot;backwards design&quot;?  Why not plan your lessons, and then your assessments, and then the class activities?"
        - "What should you do if you find that you have &quot;too many&quot; big ideas identified in Stage 1?  How might you prioritize them?"
        - "What are some class activities, assignments, or projects you have encountered in school that might work toward demonstrating competence in Stage 2?  Can you recall a particularly well-matched or poorly-matched assessment from your own life?"
        - "What are some examples of &quot;low-stakes&quot; questions you could ask your class to quickly assess their learning, prior to giving a larger assessment or assignment?"
        - "What is your favorite classroom activity format?  Do you prefer lecture, or flipped classroom, or guided inquiry, or class discussions, etc.?  What is the benefit of using a blend of activities rather than a single approach?"

## Understanding by Design: An Example

### Title: Introduction to Binary Numbers

### Grade Level: Middle School (6-8)

### Stage 1 - Desired Results

#### Established Goals:

Students will understand the concept of binary numbers and how to convert between binary and decimal systems.

#### Understandings:

* Binary numbers are base 2 numbers that only use 0s and 1s.
* Binary numbers are the basis for how data is stored in computers.
* There are patterns and procedures for converting between binary and decimal number systems.

#### Essential Questions:

* How are binary numbers different from the decimal numbers we normally use?
* Why do computers use binary numbers to represent data?
* What patterns and procedures can be used to convert between binary and decimal numbers?

#### Students will know...

* Binary numbers have a base of 2 and only use the digits 0 and 1.
* Computers store all data as binary numbers.
* There are algorithms for converting binary to decimal and vice versa.

#### Students will be able to...

* Explain the concept of binary as a base 2 number system using 0s and 1s.
* Convert binary numbers to decimal numbers and vice versa.
* Explain why binary numbers are used to store data in computers.

### Stage 2 - Assessment Evidence

#### Performance Tasks:

* Given a set of binary numbers, students will convert them into decimal numbers.
* Given a set of decimal numbers, students will convert them into binary numbers.

#### Other Evidence:

* Exit tickets with binary conversion problems.
* Worksheets practicing binary to decimal conversions.
* Quiz on binary number concepts and conversion algorithms.

### Stage 3 - Learning Plan

* [Introduce](https://studio.code.org/s/csp1-2022/lessons/4) the concept of binary as a base 2 number system using 0s and 1s. Compare it to the base 10 decimal number system they currently use. Discuss how computers store data using binary numbers.

* Provide [examples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ecO5-Vg8eQVVvpjIUX8P0dAVX2Mi1-QW7zfIMFWeqgY/edit) of converting small binary numbers to decimal. Point out patterns in the place values of binary numbers. Provide practice problems and grade as a class.

* Introduce the algorithm for converting decimal numbers to binary. Model examples step-by-step on the board. Provide practice problems and allow students to work independently or in pairs. Review as a class.

* Provide a variety of binary conversion problems as practice. Use worksheets, exit tickets, homework, etc. Give quiz to assess understanding.
