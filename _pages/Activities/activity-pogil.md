      title: Exploring Compression via Pixel Pandemonium
      questions:
        - "Share the total number of bytes (integers) used to encode the uncompressed and compressed versions of this image.  What is the compression ratio?"
        - "Which image tiles feature the best compression?  What do they have in common?"
        - "Which image tiles feature the worst compression, and why?"
        - "Is this compression lossless?  In other words, can the original data be re-created exactly from only the compressed encoding?"
        - "Do you think it is always necessary to have lossy compression for images and sound?  When might they?  What are some applications that require lossless compression?"
        - "Suppose you had to use the same color in each row and/or column of this image.  What arrangement would provide the best compression, and which would yield the worst?"

### Sample Lesson Plan: Understanding Data Compression through POGIL

#### Objective:
Students will understand the concept of data compression, its types (lossy and lossless), and its applications in computing.

#### Duration:
90 minutes

#### Materials:
- Pre-prepared POGIL activity sheets
- Computers with compression software (e.g., WinRAR, 7-Zip)
- Sample files for compression (text, image, audio)

#### Pre-Class Preparation:
- Divide students into groups of 4.
- Prepare POGIL activity sheets with guided inquiry questions.
- Ensure that the necessary software and files are available on the computers.

#### Lesson Structure:

##### Introduction (10 minutes)
- Introduce the concept of data compression.
- Explain the importance of data compression in computing.
- Briefly describe the POGIL method and the collaborative nature of the activity.

##### Activity 1: Exploring Compression (30 minutes)
- **Task**: Students will compress a text file using different compression algorithms.
- **Guided Questions**:
  - What is the original size of the file?
  - What is the size after compression?
  - What is the compression ratio?
  - How does the choice of algorithm affect the compression ratio?
- **Discussion**: Facilitate a class discussion on the observations.

##### Activity 2: Lossy vs. Lossless Compression (30 minutes)
- **Task**: Students will compress an image file using both lossy and lossless compression methods.
- **Guided Questions**:
  - What are the differences between the original and compressed images?
  - How does lossy compression affect the quality?
  - What are the applications of lossy and lossless compression?
- **Discussion**: Facilitate a class discussion on the differences between lossy and lossless compression.

##### Activity 3: Ethical Considerations (10 minutes)
- **Task**: Students will discuss the ethical considerations of data compression, especially in the context of media and information dissemination.
- **Guided Questions**:
  - What are the ethical implications of using lossy compression in journalism or medical imaging?
  - How can data compression be used responsibly?
- **Discussion**: Facilitate a class discussion on the ethical considerations.

##### Conclusion (10 minutes)
- Summarize the key concepts learned.
- Discuss real-world applications of data compression.
- Assign a reflective essay or project on implementing a simple compression algorithm.

#### Assessment:
- Formative assessment through observation during activities.
- Summative assessment through a reflective essay or project.

#### Reflection:
Encourage students to reflect on the process of inquiry and collaboration. Discuss how the POGIL method facilitated their understanding of data compression.

### Conclusion:
This lesson plan leverages the POGIL method to provide an engaging and collaborative learning experience. It not only covers the technical aspects of data compression but also encourages critical thinking and ethical considerations. By actively involving students in the learning process, it aims to foster a deep understanding of the subject matter.
