## Learning by Discovery: Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning in Computer Science (CS-POGIL)

Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) is an educational approach that promotes active learning and concept development through guided inquiry in small groups. CS-POGIL specifically applies this method to Computer Science education, providing students with opportunities to learn by discovering concepts and solving problems collaboratively.

This report aims to provide an overview of CS-POGIL, including its principles, benefits, and implementation strategies. Key references, including CS-POGIL materials and additional scholarly articles, will be summarized and cited throughout the report.

## CS-POGIL: An Overview

CS-POGIL, short for Computer Science-Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning, is an instructional strategy that utilizes active learning and collaborative group work to engage students in the learning process. It is based on the principles of POGIL, which emphasizes the use of guided inquiry activities to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills in students.

CS-POGIL creates an environment where students actively explore, analyze, and construct their understanding of computer science concepts. By working in groups, students have the opportunity to exchange ideas, ask questions, and learn from each other's perspectives. This not only enhances their learning experience but also promotes teamwork and communication skills.

## CS-POGIL Roles and Role Cards

The CS-POGIL Roles and Role Cards resource provides guidelines for implementing CS-POGIL activities in the classroom. It introduces a set of predefined roles that students can assume during group work to facilitate collaboration and maximize engagement. The roles include facilitator, recorder, spokesperson, and process observer.

The facilitator encourages group participation and ensures that everyone is actively engaged in the learning process. The recorder takes notes and records the group's findings. The spokesperson presents the group's ideas, solutions, and conclusions to the rest of the class. The process observer observes and assesses the group dynamics and interactions.

The use of role cards helps students understand and fulfill their respective roles effectively. The specific responsibilities and expectations associated with each role are outlined in the CS-POGIL Roles and Role Cards resource.
