      title: "Applying Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) to Computing Activities"
      questions:
        - "What are the main challenges and opportunities presented in the scenario? How do you see collaboration, empathy, ethics, or resilience playing a role in this scenario?"
        - "How can the principles of SEL be applied to the scenario from Phase 1? What strategies can be used to foster collaboration and empathy within the team?"
        - "How can ethical considerations be integrated into the decision-making process? What practices can be implemented to promote resilience and reflection?"
        - "How will you apply the SEL strategies to this new computing activity? What specific actions will you take to foster collaboration, empathy, ethics, and resilience within your team?"
        - "How will you reflect on and evaluate the effectiveness of the SEL integration in this activity? What is the benefit of using a blend of SEL principles rather than a single approach?"

## Social Emotional Learning (SEL)
Social Emotional Learning (SEL) refers to the process through which individuals acquire and apply knowledge, skills, and attitudes to develop healthy identities, manage emotions, achieve personal and collective goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain supportive relationships, and make responsible and caring decisions. SEL has become an increasingly important part of education, as schools seek to support the whole child and promote both academic and life success. This report provides an overview of SEL and discusses ways to integrate SEL into computer science education.
SEL is a crucial aspect of personal and academic development. It focuses on teaching individuals to understand and manage their emotions, develop healthy relationships, and make responsible decisions. 

### Fundamentals of SEL 
The Fundamentals of SEL provided by the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) is a comprehensive resource that presents the core competencies of SEL. These competencies include:
1. **Self-awareness:** Recognizing and understanding one's emotions, values, strengths, and weaknesses.
2. **Self-management:** Regulating one's emotions, controlling impulses, and setting and achieving goals.
3. **Social awareness:** Developing empathy, understanding others' perspectives, and appreciating diversity.
4. **Relationship skills:** Establishing and maintaining positive relationships, communicating effectively, and resolving conflicts.
5. **Responsible decision-making:** Making choices based on ethical considerations, evaluating consequences, and taking responsibility for actions.

CASEL's Fundamentals of SEL serves as an excellent starting point for understanding the key principles of SEL.

Research shows SEL can have significant benefits for students, including improved academic performance, attitudes, behaviors and relationships. It provides students with tools to navigate emotions, set goals, build relationships, and make responsible decisions.
Social Emotional Learning (SEL) plays a vital role in the holistic development of individuals. The core competencies of SEL, as outlined by CASEL's Fundamentals of SEL, provide a strong foundation for understanding SEL principles. 
By implementing SEL practices, educators can foster emotional intelligence, interpersonal skills, and responsible decision-making among students.
SEL skills are essential for living ethically, working effectively with others, and positively impacting fields like computer science. Integrating SEL into computer science classrooms can not only support students' technical abilities, but also their development as healthy, caring, responsible members of society.

## SEL in Computer Science Education

Computer science courses provide many opportunities to foster social emotional competencies alongside technical skills. A few examples include:

1. Promoting a growth mindset when learning new concepts and languages. Computer science often requires perseverance through confusion and debugging. Helping students cultivate self-awareness around their learning process can support grit and resilience.

2. Incorporating team-based projects. Group work not only builds technical collaboration skills, but also relationship and communication skills students will need in future careers. Reflection activities can help reinforce lessons around team dynamics, conflict resolution and interpersonal awareness.

3. Discussing ethics and social impact. Computing innovations have many ethical implications for society. Classroom discussions, case studies and ethical coding challenges can build students' sense of social responsibility and skills in ethical analysis and decision-making.

4. Critiquing biases. Dataset bias, algorithmic bias and human biases all affect computer science. Making space for students to critically examine their own biases and those embedded in technological systems can promote social awareness, perspective-taking and responsible innovation.

5. Promoting wellbeing and work-life balance. Computer science education often has intense workloads. Educators can model and explicitly teach strategies for managing stress, maintaining self-care, and achieving balance and fulfillment in academics and life.

Social emotional learning focuses on building self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills and responsible decision-making. Integrating SEL into computer science education can help students build technical abilities while also fostering skills critical for collaborative, ethical work and lifelong success. SEL represents a valuable framework for supporting the whole student within computer science.

## Example Integrations

### Playing a Tin Foil Piano Using a Micro:bit
**Lesson Objective**: Students will create a tin foil piano using a micro:bit and write code to play different notes.

**SEL Integration**:
- **Collaboration**: Students can work in pairs or small groups to design and build the piano. They can discuss their ideas, listen to each other, and make decisions together.
- **Creativity and Expression**: Encourage students to personalize their pianos and compose their own melodies. This fosters creativity and allows students to express themselves through music.
- **Reflection**: After the activity, facilitate a discussion about the challenges faced and how they were overcome. This encourages self-awareness and resilience.

### Converting Binary Numbers to Decimal
**Lesson Objective**: Students will learn to convert binary numbers to decimal numbers.

**SEL Integration**:
- **Critical Thinking**: Present real-world scenarios where binary-to-decimal conversion is used, such as in computer networking. Encourage students to analyze and discuss the importance of this skill.
- **Peer Teaching**: Pair students and have them teach each other the conversion process. This fosters empathy and communication skills.
- **Mindfulness**: Incorporate mindfulness practices to help students focus and approach the task with calmness, especially if they find it challenging.
