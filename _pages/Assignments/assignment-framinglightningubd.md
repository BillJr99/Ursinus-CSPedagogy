    description: Application of UbD Principles
    preemerging: The principles are not enumerated and/or not applied to the lightning talk.
    beginning: An attempt is made to demonstrate some of the principles of UbD, but the ideas do not align with the framework.  
    progressing: Lists some of the guiding UbD principles. Applies at least some of these principles to the lightning talk, showing a clear alignment with the end goal and evidence of competency.
    proficient: Demonstrates a comprehensive and nuanced consideration of UbD principles. Applies these principles to the lightning talk, showing a clear alignment with the end goal and evidence of competency.

    description: Video Reflection
    preemerging: Provides minimal or no reflection on the video by Grant Wiggins. Lacks connection to personal learning experiences or teaching ideals.
    beginning: Provides a basic reflection on the video but struggles to connect it to personal learning experiences or teaching ideals. May lack depth or insight.
    progressing: Provides a thoughtful reflection on the video, connecting it to personal learning experiences or teaching ideals with minor inconsistencies or lack of depth.
    proficient: Provides a deep and insightful reflection on the video, seamlessly connecting it to personal learning experiences and teaching ideals. Demonstrates a strong grasp of the implications for computer science education.

    description: Revision and Enhancement of Lightning Talk
    preemerging: Provides minimal or no revision of the lightning talk. Lacks clear application of UbD principles or consideration of end goals.
    beginning: Provides basic revision of the lightning talk but struggles to apply UbD principles or articulate clear end goals. Some inconsistencies or misunderstandings are evident.
    progressing: Provides thoughtful revision of the lightning talk, applying UbD principles and articulating clear end goals with minor errors or omissions.
    proficient: Provides a thorough revision of the lightning talk, applying UbD principles and articulating clear end goals. Demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of how the talk has changed and why.
  - weight: 25
    description: Quality of Writing and Report Structure
    preemerging: The report is poorly organized, lacks clarity, and contains numerous grammatical errors. Fails to compile the discussion and reflections into a comprehensive report.
    beginning: The report is somewhat organized but may lack clarity or contain grammatical errors. Struggles to compile the discussion and reflections into a cohesive report.
    progressing: The report is well-organized and mostly clear, with minor grammatical errors or inconsistencies. The discussion and reflections are included in a comprehensive report with minor omissions.
    proficient: The report is exceptionally well-organized, clear, and free of grammatical errors. The discussion and reflections are synthesized into a comprehensive and insightful report.

In this written report assignment, you will discuss in detail how to apply the principles of Understanding by Design (UbD), and in particular, Backward Design, to the lightning talk you gave previously. You will also reflect on the video by Grant Wiggins found on the [Understanding by Design guide](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/understanding-by-design/) page.

Begin by watching the video by Grant Wiggins on the Understanding by Design guide page.  Reflect on his commentary on education in general.  A few items he raises that catch my attention are:

* "It's your job to know where you want to end up."
* The need to teach critical and creative thinking over compliance
* Teaching as "value added:" Not relying on enrolling "smart students" as a measure of graduating successful ones

You do not need to comment on these per se, but you should reflect upon his guidance for teachers in the context of your own learning experiences.  Can you recall a time when a teacher (grade school or higher education) applied the ideals for which Wiggins advocates?  If not, recall a time when you feel your learning would have been enhanced by them, and how.  

With these ideas in mind, reflect upon your lightning talk(s).  Revise them according to these principles of Understanding by Design: that is, with an eye toward the end goal.  How does your talk differ given that your content is driven entirely by progress toward your goals for your learners (and your audience)?  

You will give your revised lightning talk, but in this report, you will describe how your perspective on presentiation has changed, and how the structure and content of your lightning talk has changed.  In particular, if your lightning talk didn't have an end goal, you should explicitly craft one (or more).  In addition, if you did not have ways of connecting the "take-home problem" to evidence of competency toward that goal, you should make this explicit as well.

## Instructions
- **Watch the Video**: Watch the video by Grant Wiggins on the Understanding by Design guide page.
- **Review Your Lightning Talk**: Review the lightning talk you gave previously.
- **Apply UbD Principles**: Discuss how you can apply the principles of UbD and Backward Design to enhance your lightning talk.
- **Reflect on the Video**: Reflect on the insights and implications of the video by Grant Wiggins for computer science education.
- **Write the Report**: Compile your discussion and reflections into a comprehensive written report.  In addition, revise and submit your lightning talk materials.
