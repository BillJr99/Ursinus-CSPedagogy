# Assignment Overview
In this written report assignment, you will discuss in detail how to apply the principles of Understanding by Design (UbD), and in particular, Backward Design, to the lightning talk you gave previously. You will also reflect on the video by Grant Wiggins found on the [Understanding by Design guide](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/understanding-by-design/) page.

# Instructions
- **Watch the Video**: Watch the video by Grant Wiggins on the Understanding by Design guide page.
- **Review Your Lightning Talk**: Review the lightning talk you gave previously.
- **Apply UbD Principles**: Discuss how you can apply the principles of UbD and Backward Design to enhance your lightning talk.
- **Reflect on the Video**: Reflect on the insights and implications of the video by Grant Wiggins for computer science education.
- **Write the Report**: Compile your discussion and reflections into a comprehensive written report.

# Notes
- **Understanding UbD**: Familiarize yourself with the principles of Understanding by Design and Backward Design by reading the provided materials and watching the video.
- **Application to Lightning Talk**: Consider how you can apply these principles to enhance the coherence, alignment, and engagement of your lightning talk.
- **Reflection**: Reflecting on the video and its insights is a key component of this assignment. Consider what you learned and how it applies to your teaching practice in computer science.
