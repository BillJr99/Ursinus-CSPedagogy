  rubric:

    description: Forming the Research Question
    preemerging: Presents a question that is not answerable from a consideration of research literature (for example, a superficial statement of opinion).
    beginning: Presents a reasonable research question about the applicability of CS across the disciplines, but presents the question in a one-sided way (such that the answer is trivially in the affirmative or in the negative).
    progressing: Demonstrates a reasonable research question about teaching and learning CS across the disciplines.  A thesis statement is provided in response to the research question.
    proficient: Demonstrates a comprehensive research question about the applicability of CS curricular material in non-CS classrooms, inclusive pedagogy, and the potential risks and opportunities.  A thesis statement is provided in response to the research question.
  - weight: 20
    description: Literature Analysis
    preemerging: No critical analysis of relevant literature is offered in support of the research question and/or thesis statement.
    beginning: Reasonable critical analysis of the Pollock paper that is considered in the context of the research question and thesis statement.
    progressing: Reasonable critical analysis of the Pollock paper that is considered in the context of the research question and thesis statement, and at least a summary level of detail about other relevant literature.
    proficient: Thorough and critical analysis of relevant literature, including the article by Pollock, that identifies key themes, contradictions, and gaps in the literature.
  - weight: 20
    description: Synthesis
    preemerging: The papers are treated individually without synthesis or conclusions with respect to the research question.
    beginning: Some connections are made between the articles considered that support the research question in the form of a survey.
    progressing: Literature is synthesized for common themes in support of the research question and thesis statement.
    proficient: Strong consideration of the relevant literature on the whole to propose well-considered opportunities, risks, and mitigation strategies. Demonstrates creativity and insight in envisioning possibilities.
  - weight: 20
    description: References
    preemerging: References are not appropriate or are not clearly cited in the paper.
    beginning: Appropriate references are provided require re-writing to provide proper citations.
    progressing: References are provided in a quantity and relevance to suggest cohesion.  Few errors in the use of a citation standard.
    proficient: References are provided in a quantity and relevance to support the theme of the paper.  Consistent use of a citation standard format (e.g., APA, MLA).   
  - weight: 20
    description: Organization and Writing Quality
    preemerging: At least two of the following are missing from the paper, or are written in an unclear manner - introduction, conclusion, and abstract.
    beginning: An introduction, conclusion, or abstract are missing from the paper.  Writing lacks formality, structure, and/or syntax.
    progressing: Generally clear writing with minor inconsistencies in structure or citation format. Few grammatical errors. A cohesive abstract, introduction, and conclusion are provided.
    proficient: Clear, concise, and well-structured writing. A cohesive abstract, introduction, and conclusion are provided.  Error-free grammar and syntax.

In this assignment, you will write and submit an article reflecting upon the potential applicability of CS curricular material in a non-CS classroom (either a traditional subject area, in an environment for English language learners, in support of social-emotional learning, or in a special education setting), and how inclusive pedagogy can be used to design an accessible learning environment for all learners.

Computing and computational thinking are ubiquitous skills for all learners.  One need not pursue a degree in computer science to benefit from the applied scientific mindset and tools for automation that computing provides.  However, it is also the case that many schools are unable to offer computing education to their students directly.  Additionally, computing fits well into a variety of application domains; it is possible that one could teach computing in the context of those domains by fitting it into those classes, enhancing the teaching and learning of both.

This idea is not without risk.  It is possible that the treatment of computing in those disciplines is superficial, and becomes a barrier to learning both computing and the application domain.  It may also be the case that teachers of those disciplines are comfortable with the way they teach their field, and do not feel they would benefit from the additional time and effort required to teach computing.  

In this article, you will explore these potential issues by reading and synthesizing relevant literature.  The [article](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3287324.3287469) by Pollock *et al*, and its references, are a useful (but not exhaustive) place to begin.  You should identify both the opportunities and risks to this approach, and where risks exist, comment upon ways to mitigate them.  For example, how might we create a more supportive environment to teach computing as a ubiquitous skill?  What resources might we share to facilitate the ubiquitous teaching of computing?  Learn about the strengths and weaknesses, and envision the possibilities based upon your conclusions.

Cite your sources using a consistent citation standard format (such as APA, MLA, *etc*).  There is not a set limit upon the number of pages or the number of references you cite; however, a thorough treatment of the question is expected.  Follow the guidance afforded by the references you consult (including [Pollock](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3287324.3287469)).
