# Applying UDL and CS4All to Lesson Planning

## Overview
In this assignment, you will explore how the principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) and the Computer Science for All (CS4All) movement can be applied to make computer science education more accessible, engaging, and equitable.

Reflect on each of the 9 elements of the UDL framework, and the [12 Principles of Computing Pedagogy](https://teachcomputing.org/pedagogy).  Think about how they could be used to truly bring computing to *all* learners: across gender and other underrepresented axes, to other disciplines, and/or across all grade levels.  Your report does not need to address every one of these ideas.  Instead, you should form a thesis addressing what you believe is the most important change that needs to happen in the next 10 years to improve and facilitate access to computing education.  Support your claim with relevant research literature, and frame your ideas within these existing frameworks.  What should computing education look like for the next generation so that it represents and improvement over your own experiences?

You will reflect on these principles and write a report discussing how they could be integrated into your own lesson planning.

## Instructions
Read the provided materials on UDL and CS4All to understand the core principles and goals of each framework.

In a written report, address the following:
- Summary of UDL principles and how they can enhance accessibility and engagement in CS lessons.
- Summary of CS4All goals and pedagogical principles, and how they promote equity in CS education.
- Discussion of how UDL and CS4All principles align, and could be integrated into a CS lesson plan.
- Concrete examples of how you could apply these principles to make your own CS lesson plan more accessible, engaging, and equitable.
- Properly cite at least 5 sources on UDL and CS4All in your report.
